# Phase 3 Project: Song Collector

## Introduction

- This is the backend for our web application. It uses Sinatra and Active Record
to generate our data for the song collection.

**Important**: Be sure you fork a copy of the repo into your GitHub account

The `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file has an example GET route
handler. Replace this route with routes for your project.

You can start your server with:

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).
